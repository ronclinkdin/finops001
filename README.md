This project demonstrates how to retrieve billing profiles from Microsoft Partner Center using Python. It utilizes the Partner Center API to obtain billing information for a specified customer.

Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x installed on your machine
requests library installed (you can install it using pip install requests)
Microsoft Partner Center account with appropriate permissions
Register an application in Azure Active Directory and obtain the client ID and client secret
Obtain the customer ID for which you want to retrieve the billing profile
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Set up environment variables for the following values:

CLIENT_ID: Client ID of the registered application in Azure Active Directory.
CLIENT_SECRET: Client Secret of the registered application in Azure Active Directory.
CUSTOMER_ID: Customer ID for which you want to retrieve the billing profile.
Modify the api_version variable in the script if needed, depending on the version of the Partner Center API you wish to use.

Run the script by executing the Python file in your terminal:

Copy code
python retrieve_billing_profile.py
The script will obtain the access token, make an API request to retrieve the billing profile, and print the response content to the console. You can then process the response data as needed.

Important Note
Ensure that the registered application in Azure Active Directory has the necessary permissions to access the Partner Center API.
Handle sensitive information such as client secret and customer ID securely. Avoid hardcoding these values directly in your code.
Review and understand the Partner Center API documentation for more details on available endpoints and request/response formats.
